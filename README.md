# Tone tag dictionary

This is a WIP site to provide a dictionary of all tone tags! Provides the common usages, examples, and explanations as to why they're used.

### Usage

The home page is located at [tonetags.astrid.sh](https://tonetags.astrid.sh). <br>
For direct links to specific tone tags, you can use `https://t.astrid.sh/<tone-tag>` (example: [t.astrid.sh/j](https://t.astrid.sh/j))

### Contributing

This website is a living resource. Data will change frequently, new tone tags will be added, and etc. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@maybeastrid](https://twitter.com/maybeastrid) if you have any suggestions! For those savy with code, feel free to make a PR with edits to tone tag information.
